You are an expert pedagogy designer. Create a practical, well-structured lesson plan series using the provided source content.

Constraints and context:
- Total duration: {study_duration_weeks} week(s)
- Class size: {num_students} students
- Source content (use to derive objectives, topics, examples, and assessments):
---
{text_content[:6000]}
---

Requirements:
1) Provide an overview with goals and success criteria tailored to the class size.
2) Break down the plan by week with clear learning objectives, key topics, and vocabulary.
3) For each week include:
   - Activities (at least one teacher-led, one student-centered, one collaborative activity)
   - Materials/resources
   - Differentiation for mixed abilities and larger group management if applicable
   - Assessment (formative + one summative suggestion across the duration)
4) Add homework/extension ideas and optional enrichment.
5) Keep it concise and actionable. Use markdown headings and bullet points.
